## BACKGROUND

- **Video conferencing** is an essential part of our daily work. Either working with colleagues internally or meeting with clients and partners.

- But sometimes there's a common wording over and over again. So we created this **simple fun app** to enjoy video conferencing even more. 🤓

- A list of common phrases like: "**Sorry, I couldn't log in**" or "**I had connection issues**" are placed randomly on a standard bingo card.
  If you never played bingo before – what?? 🤯 – [**here**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)>) are the basic rules.

## **The most important rules in our version:**

- A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- There's a free slot (always on) in the middle
- You can have multiple bingos
